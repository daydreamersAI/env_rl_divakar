If the rewards aren't increasing during training, there could be several reasons for this. Let's examine some potential issues and how to address them:

Learning rate too high or too low:
The current learning rate is set to 0.001:
pythonCopyself.optimizer = optim.Adam(self.q_network.parameters(), lr=0.001)
If it's too high, the network might overshoot optimal values. If too low, learning might be too slow. Try adjusting this value, perhaps starting with 0.0001 or 0.0005.
Infrequent target network updates:
The target network is updated every 1000 steps:
pythonCopyself.target_update_frequency = 1000
This might be too infrequent. Try reducing this to 100 or 500.
Insufficient exploration:
The epsilon decay might be too fast. The current implementation uses:
pythonCopyself.epsilon = DecayingFloat(value=0.9, factor=1.0-1e-6, minval=0.05)
This decay factor is very small, meaning epsilon will decay very slowly. You might want to increase this factor for faster decay, e.g., 1.0-1e-4.
Memory buffer size and sampling:
The current memory size is 10000 and batch size is 64. These might need adjustment:
pythonCopyself.memory_size = 10000
self.batch_size = 64
Try increasing the memory size to 100000 and the batch size to 128 or 256.
Network architecture:
The current network might be too simple for your problem. Consider adding more layers or increasing the number of neurons:
pythonCopyclass DQNNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim, output_dim):
        super(DQNNetwork, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_dim, 256)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(256, 256)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(256, 256)
        self.fc4 = nn.Linear(256, output_dim)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = torch.relu(self.fc2(x))
        x = torch.relu(self.fc3(x))
        x = self.fc4(x)
        return x

Reward scaling:
If the rewards have a large scale, consider normalizing them. You can add a method to scale rewards:
pythonCopydef scale_reward(self, reward):
    return reward / 100.0  # Adjust the divisor based on your reward scale
Then use this in store_transition and execute methods.
Gradient clipping:
To prevent exploding gradients, add gradient clipping:
pythonCopytorch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(self.q_network.parameters(), max_norm=1.0)
Add this line just before self.optimizer.step() in the optimize_model method.
Learning from non-terminal states:
The current implementation doesn't distinguish between terminal and non-terminal states. You might want to add a 'done' flag to your transitions and adjust the Q-value update accordingly.
Monitoring and debugging:
Add logging to track key metrics like average Q-values, loss, and epsilon value over time. This can help identify where the learning process might be failing.

To implement these changes, you'd need to modify the relevant parts of the code. After making these adjustments, monitor the training process closely. If rewards still aren't increasing, it might be worth examining the environment itself to ensure that the reward structure is conducive to learning.
Would you like me to elaborate on any of these suggestions or provide code snippets for implementation?
